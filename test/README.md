# Data for running Nucleosome Dynamics

Nucleosome dynamics can be tested with the sample input data you find at `test/data`. It includes:

1. MNase-seq reads
2. Reference genome associated data

#### 1. MNase-seq reads

`test/data/cellcycle*` files are sample MNase-seq reads aligned BAM files. 
TDB
RData and BAI files are needed?
Do we want to include output sample data?

#### 2. Reference genome associated data
